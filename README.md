--Introduction--

The aim of the project is to study the various factors responsible for the impact on its citizens like Social Expenditure, Gross Fiscal Deficit, Tax collection, Nominal GDP, etc.

--Problem aimed to solve--

As we know, India is a big country with a large population to serve. In such cases, it becomes necessary to study the various factors that can have an impact on the larger population for better transparency and reduced corruption. Analyzing the different state's data will help us in this regard to have an eye on the states which are doing great and the states which aren't. 

--Data Description--

1. Excel Files: This folder has an Excel workbook having the final Dashboard and worksheets having the cleaned dataset of different states in. XLSX format.
2. SQL query: This folder has a SQL query that I used to merge the data in a 5-year span (like 1980-1985 etc.) as the data was in yearly format (like 1980-1981, etc.)

--Methodolgy--

The project involves collecting and processing different Indian state data from the years 1980 to 2020. It utilizes data analysis techniques to have insights about Capital expenditure, gross fiscal deficit, tax revenue, nominal GDP, and its impact on different regions.
