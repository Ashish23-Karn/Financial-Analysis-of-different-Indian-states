# Financial-Analysis-of-different-Indian-states
--Introduction--

As we know, India is a big country with a large population to serve. In such cases, it becomes necessary to study the various factors that can have an impact on the larger population for better transparency, reduced corruption and to help the policymakers to make the decisions. Analyzing the different state's data will help us in this regard to have an eye on the states which are doing great and the states which aren't.

--Problem aimed to solve--

The aim of the project is to study the various factors responsible to have an impact on the socio-economic fiber of the country such as Social Expenditure, Gross Fiscal Deficit, Tax collection, Nominal GDP, etc.
 
--Data Description--

1. Excel Files: This folder has an Excel workbook having the final Dashboard and worksheets having the cleaned dataset of different states in. XLSX format.
2. SQL query: This folder has a SQL query that I used to merge the data in a 5-year span (like 1980-1985 etc.) as the data was in yearly format (like 1980-1981, etc.)

--Methodolgy--

The project involves collecting and processing different Indian state data from the years 1980 to 2020. It utilizes data analysis techniques to have insights about Capital expenditure, gross fiscal deficit, tax revenue, nominal GDP, and its impact on different regions.

--Phases--

1. Get the data from Kaggle
2. Data cleaning using Excel
3. Analyzing the data using SQL
4. Data visualization/Dashboard by using Excel

--DashBoard Creation--

Here is the main dashboard which is dynamic in nature and the slicer added is for different states.

--Insights--
Through Excel DashBoard, the project represents some valuable insights in a visually engaging manner, using charts, graphs, and slicers. These visual representations help to show the trend for different states for various factors, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and develop appropriate development models statewise.

As we can see from the chart, Uttar Pradesh is having the highest 'Capital Expenditure' in all the states, the possible reason is its population.

Here, From the "States with Higher Fiscal Deficit" chart, we can see Maharastra is having the highest Fiscal deficit followed by Uttar Pradesh, the possible reason may be, as Maharastra is an economic hub and responsible for higher economic activity in all the states, so it has to spend more on various development project and schemes.

Here are the top 5 states with the highest tax collection, As Maharastra is an Economic hub, the tax generated from here is also the highest, responsible for 30% of the overall whole of India followed by Tamilnadu and Uttar Pradesh.

Here is the nominal GDP chart, representing the top Indian states based on their GDP, here again, Maharastra is having the lead followed by Uttar Pradesh.

Here is the correlation chart between tax generated and social expenditure amount, from here one can conclude that states with higher tax collection will have more to spend on social schemes.


--Challenges and learnings--
1. The main challenge posed by this project was to merge the data in a five-year plan (FYPs) as all the data were in a yearly format.
   For this purpose, I used SQL to do the task.
   
--Overall, The project can serve as a valuable resource for Indian policymakers, and the general public interested in gaining insights about mentioned factors about their native states.
